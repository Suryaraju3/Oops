# __Oops -Object oriented programming structure__
 
### __Class__
* class is blueprint for creating object.
### __Object__
* Object is an instance of a class or real time entity.

#### Ex:1

* WhatsApp is a class name.
* inside one variable.
* wtsapp is an object created for class name.

### Ex:2

###  __init__()
* It's a inbuilt method which used to inizialize the members of an object.
* for __init__() method self first argument which has to be pass.
* for __init__() method we can pass any number of parameter based on the requirement.
*  __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
* __self__ To access instance variables. self is not a keyword; it's just a name by convention. You can use another name, but not recommended.

### Four pillers of oops
* 1.Inheritance
* 2.Polymorphism
* 3.Abstraction 
* 4.Encapsulation

#### 1.Inheritance
 ->State and behaviour from parents class to child class is known as inheritance. It's five types
1.Single level inheritance
* parent class to child class.
* In WhatsApp_v1, contacts were added in the chatting box.
* In WhatsApp_v2, camara were added in the chatting box.
* The new version(v2) adds on WhatsApp not exiting _v1; _v2 inherited _v1 and is now an inheritance.
* When we create object _v2, we can use _v2 and _v1 also.
